## Briefly

A simple react app that includes movies, tv series and relevant information thanks to TMDB Api(https://developers.themoviedb.org/3).
Includes 3 sections: Login, Main, Detail

Login Page : Enables user to sign in with email adress and password only.\
Main       : Includes movie list with categoriezed lines according to filters and users interactions such as filtering by category/year or keywords. If user signs in, an additional line appears as the recommended movies to user's name.\
Detail     : User can select a movie from the main page and see the brief details about the movie such as name, release year, rating and an abstract of the movie.\
